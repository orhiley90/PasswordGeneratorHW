# PasswordGeneratorHW

This project is to aid people in the creation of randomly generated passwords. The user in question will be prompted with a series of questions including length needed, then which character cases are wanted to be used. 

Currently the password is generated in the box above the button. 

To use the application simply the Generate Password button. From there enter your required length and which sets of special characters you would like to use.
